# 🔭 Particle Hunting with Hypathia  
*Exploring High-Energy Events in the ATLAS Detector*

![ATLAS Exploration](Resources/atlas_event.png) <!-- Replace with your real image -->

## 👋 About This Project
This repository is dedicated to my personal exploration using **Hypathia**, a particle physics visualization software used to analyze real collision events from **CERN’s ATLAS experiment**.

My goal is to investigate **high-energy particles** appearing in the *outer regions of the detector* and identify which particle might be responsible — muons, taus, or something more exotic.

## 🎯 Scientific Objective
> **Mission:** To locate and identify anomalous particle tracks in extreme energy events  
> **Focus Region:** Outer layers of the ATLAS detector (Muon Spectrometer)

I am particularly interested in:
- Highly energetic tracks escaping inner detectors  
- Long-lived particles crossing multiple subdetectors  
- Possible signals beyond the Standard Model (BSM)

## 🛠 Tools & Environment
| Tool / Dataset   | Purpose |
|------------------|------------------------------|
| **Hypathia**     | Event visualization & tracking |
| **ATLAS Data**   | Real proton–proton collisions |
| **CERN Open Data** | Source of events (Run 1 & Run 2) |

## 🔍 Workflow
1. Load event files (.hyp) in Hypathia  
2. Analyze track curvature, energy, and detector layer impact  
3. Trace suspicious particles to identify their type  
4. Compare with known particle signatures

## 🧪 What I Am Looking For
- Muons exiting at high momentum  
- Events with large transverse momentum (p<sub>T</sub>)  
- Unusual track patterns hinting at new physics

## 📸 Event Snapshots
Here I include images of candidate events and my observations:
