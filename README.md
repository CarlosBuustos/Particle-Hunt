# Particle Hunting with Hypathia  
*Exploring High-Energy Events in the ATLAS Detector*

![Working on Hypathia](Resources/working.png) <!-- Main image -->

This repository documents my early exploration in particle physics using **Hypathia**, a visualization tool for analyzing collision events from **CERN’s ATLAS experiment**.  
During my first week at the **Institute of Nuclear Physics (IFJ PAN), Poland**, I began investigating high-energy events with the aim of recognizing particle signatures and understanding their trajectories within the detector.

## Scientific Objective
**Mission:** To locate and identify anomalous particle tracks in extreme energy events  
**Focus Region:** Outer layers of the ATLAS detector (Muon Spectrometer)

I am particularly interested in:
- Highly energetic tracks escaping inner detectors  
- Long-lived particles crossing multiple subdetector layers  
- Potential hints of particles beyond the Standard Model (BSM)

## Tools & Environment
| Tool / Dataset     | Purpose                                 |
|--------------------|------------------------------------------|
| **Hypathia**       | Event visualization & track analysis     |
| **ATLAS Data**     | Real proton–proton collisions            |
| **CERN Open Data** | Source of events (Run 1 & Run 2)         |

## What I Am Looking For
- Muons with high transverse momentum (p<sub>T</sub>)  
- Events extending to the detector’s boundaries  
- Unusual curvature or signatures suggesting new physics

## Event Snapshots
Here I include images of candidate events and my observations:
